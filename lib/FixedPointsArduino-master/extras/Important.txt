Do not attempt to use anything from the Details namespace.
Everything in the Details namespace is merely an implementation detail which may be changed without notice,
thus any attempt to use anything from the Details namespace may result in your own code breaking in future updates. 

To wrap the fixed point types in the FixedPoints namespace (e.g. in case of name conflicts):
#define FIXED_POINTS_USE_NAMESPACE
